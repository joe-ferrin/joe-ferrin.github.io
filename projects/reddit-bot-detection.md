\# Reddit Bot Detection



\## Overview

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to detect anomalous and illegitimate users in Reddit comment networks.  

The goal is to identify bot-like behavior without relying on labeled training data.



\## Data

\- Reddit comment interaction data

\- User-to-user interaction network

\- Large-scale, sparse, and highly imbalanced



\## Approach

\- Graph construction from user interaction data

\- Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques

\- Feature engineering on network structure and user activity

\- Interactive visualization of anomalous users and connections



\## Results

The model successfully identified clusters of anomalous users exhibiting:

\- Unusual connectivity patterns

\- Automated or highly regular activity behavior
