# Reddit Bot Detection

## Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to detect anomalous and illegitimate users in Reddit comment networks.  
The goal is to identify bot-like behavior without relying on labeled training data.

## Data
- Reddit comment interaction data
- User-to-user interaction network
- Large-scale, sparse, and highly imbalanced

## Approach
- Graph construction from user interaction data
- Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques
- Feature engineering on network structure and user activity
- Interactive visualization of anomalous users and connections

## Results
The model successfully identified clusters of anomalous users exhibiting:
- Unusual connectivity patterns
- Automated or highly regular activity behavior
