\# Art Image Captioning



\## Overview

This project explores deep learning methods for generating captions for artwork that capture both semantic content and artistic style.  

Unlike standard image captioning tasks, the focus is on describing visual art rather than natural images.



\## Data

\- Artwork images paired with human-written descriptions

\- Emphasis on artistic style and expressive language



\## Approach

\- Deep learning models for image captioning

\- Training and evaluation using PyTorch

\- Analysis of semantic accuracy and stylistic expressiveness in generated captions



\## Results

The models demonstrated the ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant descriptions of artwork, with varying success in capturing stylistic attributes.
