# Industrial Equipment Degradation Detection
**Industry Practicum Project — In Progress**

## Overview
This project is part of an industry-sponsored practicum in the Georgia Tech M.S. in Analytics program.  
The goal is to analyze real-world industrial sensor data to detect equipment degradation and predict fault events.

## Data
- Multivariate time-series data collected from sensors on industrial equipment
- Real-world data with noise, missing values, and rare failure events
- Partially labeled and representative of operational industrial systems

## Approach
- Time-series preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine learning models for degradation detection and fault prediction
- Model evaluation under class imbalance and limited ground truth
- Emphasis on methods suitable for real-world industrial constraints

## Status
This project is currently in progress and will be completed during the current academic semester.

## Report and Code
Due to the nature of the industry partnership:
- The project report is **not publicly shareable**
- Code and data are **restricted under NDA**
